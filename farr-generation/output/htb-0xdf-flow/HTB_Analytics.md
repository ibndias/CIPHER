* Findings: The target IP is 10.10.11.233, Action: running nmap with command `nmap -p- --min-rate 10000 10.10.11.233`, Reasoning: to discover open ports on the target, Result: found SSH (22) and HTTP (80) ports open.

* Findings: The web server redirects to `http://analytical.htb`, Action: using `ffuf` to fuzz subdomains with the command `ffuf -u http://10.10.11.233 -H "Host: FUZZ.analytical.htb" -w /opt/SecLists/Discovery/DNS/subdomains-top1million-20000.txt -mc all -ac`, Reasoning: to identify any additional subdomains that may provide different content, Result: discovered `data.analytical.htb` which returns a different response.

* Findings: The main site `analytical.htb` is a static site for a data analytics firm, Action: analyzing the site content and structure, Reasoning: to gather information about the target and potential attack vectors, Result: identified a contact form and an email address `due@analytical.com`, but no actionable vulnerabilities.

* Findings: The `data.analytical.htb` site offers a login page for Metabase, Action: inspecting the HTTP response headers, Reasoning: to gather information about the web application and its potential vulnerabilities, Result: confirmed the use of nginx and identified the application as Metabase.

* Findings: Metabase has a known vulnerability CVE-2023-38646, Action: researching the vulnerability, Reasoning: to determine if it can be exploited for unauthorized access, Result: learned that the `setup-token` is exposed to unauthenticated users.

* Findings: The `setup-token` can be retrieved from `/api/session/properties`, Action: executing `curl data.analytical.htb/api/session/properties -s | jq -r '."setup-token"'`, Reasoning: to obtain the token needed for the exploit, Result: retrieved the `setup-token` value `249fa03d-fd94-4d5b-b94f-b4ebf3df681f`.

* Findings: A payload is needed to exploit the vulnerability, Action: crafting a malicious payload to execute a reverse shell, Reasoning: to gain unauthorized access to the system, Result: created a payload that includes a reverse shell command encoded in base64.

* Findings: The payload needs to be sent to the Metabase API, Action: using Burp Suite to modify and send the request, Reasoning: to exploit the vulnerability and execute the reverse shell, Result: received a reverse shell connection.

* Findings: The reverse shell indicates a containerized environment, Action: checking the filesystem for clues, Reasoning: to understand the environment and potential paths for privilege escalation, Result: confirmed the presence of Metabase in `/app` and identified the user `metabase`.

* Findings: The environment variables contain credentials for the `metalytics` user, Action: attempting to SSH into the host using the credentials, Reasoning: to escalate privileges and gain access to the host system, Result: successfully logged in as `metalytics`.

* Findings: The `metalytics` user has access to the `user.txt` file, Action: executing `cat user.txt`, Reasoning: to retrieve the user flag, Result: obtained the user flag.

* Findings: The nginx configuration files show two site configurations, Action: inspecting the nginx configurations, Reasoning: to identify potential misconfigurations or vulnerabilities, Result: confirmed the configuration for `data.analytical.htb` passes requests to Metabase.

* Findings: The `data.analytical.htb` configuration may allow for further exploitation, Action: analyzing the configuration for weaknesses, Reasoning: to find a way to escalate privileges to root, Result: identified potential paths for privilege escalation through the Metabase application.
* Findings: Environment variables show `META_USER=metalytics` and `META_PASS=An4lytics_ds20223#`, Action: Used the credentials to SSH into the host machine, Reasoning: The credentials provided access to the `metalytics` user, Result: Successfully logged in as `metalytics` and retrieved `user.txt`.

* Findings: The home directory of `metalytics` is empty, Action: Enumerated the filesystem for interesting files, Reasoning: To find potential files or configurations that could lead to privilege escalation, Result: No interesting files found in the home directory.

* Findings: Nginx configuration shows two site configurations, Action: Reviewed the Nginx configuration files, Reasoning: To understand how the web server is set up and if there are any vulnerabilities, Result: Identified that `data.analytical.htb` proxies to `localhost:3000`, indicating a Metabase instance.

* Findings: The web root in `/var/www/site` contains static files, Action: Listed files in the web root directory, Reasoning: To check for any web vulnerabilities or files of interest, Result: Found only static files (HTML, CSS, JS).

* Findings: The `/proc` directory is mounted with `hidepid=invisible`, Action: Checked process visibility, Reasoning: To determine if there are any processes running that could be exploited, Result: Only processes started by the `metalytics` user are visible.

* Findings: The operating system is Ubuntu 22.04, Action: Retrieved OS version information, Reasoning: To identify potential vulnerabilities associated with the OS version, Result: Confirmed the OS version.

* Findings: The kernel version is `6.2.0-25-generic`, Action: Checked kernel version for vulnerabilities, Reasoning: To find known exploits for the specific kernel version, Result: Discovered the GameOver(lay) vulnerability.

* Findings: GameOver(lay) is a vulnerability in OverlayFS, Action: Researched the vulnerability, Reasoning: To understand how it can be exploited for privilege escalation, Result: Gained knowledge of the exploit method.

* Findings: The exploit for GameOver(lay) is concise and effective, Action: Prepared to run the exploit, Reasoning: To escalate privileges from `metalytics` to `root`, Result: Successfully executed the exploit.

* Findings: The exploit command escalates privileges and runs `id`, Action: Ran the exploit command, Reasoning: To verify if the privilege escalation was successful, Result: Returned `uid=0(root)` indicating root access.

* Findings: The exploit can be modified to spawn a root shell, Action: Updated the command to replace `id` with `bash`, Reasoning: To gain an interactive root shell, Result: Successfully obtained a root shell.

* Findings: Access to `root.txt` is needed, Action: Retrieved `root.txt` file, Reasoning: To complete the objective of obtaining root privileges, Result: Successfully read the contents of `root.txt`.
